# Git Branches: List, Create, Switch to, Merge, Push, & Delete
Git lets you branch out from the original code base. This lets you more easily work with other developers, and gives you a lot of flexibility in your workflow.
Here's an example of how Git branches are useful. Let's say you need to work on a new feature for a website. You create a new branch and start working. You haven't finished your new feature, but you get a request to make a rush change that needs to go live on the site today. You switch back to the master branch, make the change, and push it live. Then you can switch back to your new feature branch and finish your work. When you're done, you merge the new feature branch into the master branch, and both the new feature and rush change are kept!
